# Multiclass Classification Performance Curve package

This is package used to evaluate performance of multiclass classification results. On the basis of calculated mcp curve, one can draw conclusions whether chosen classifiers have satisfying quality. Method plot_mcp_curve helps to visualize behavior of given set of classifiers. 

MCP curve is computed on the basis of prediction probabilities generated by classifier for a set of labels.
